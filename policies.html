                <h3>Tuition Policies</h3>
                <p>▪ Tuition is a continuing charge for a monthly rated class or classes.
                <br>▪ Tuition payments are due on the 8th day of each month.

                <br>▪ Classes for the semester end with the final show performance.
                </p>
                <h3>Production Fees</h3>
                <p>All classes that have mid or end-or-semester stage performances are charged a one-time Production Fee. Production fees cover the licensing and royalties for plays and musicals, the acquisition, creation, and maintenance of costumes, sets, and props, scripts, and publicity. Production fees are due at the time of registration in order to reserve your child’s spot in a class.</p>
                <h3>Payment methods</h3>

                </p>
                <h3>Withdrawal Policy</h3>
                <p>Upon class enrollment, students are expected to complete the semester. Shows rely on the commitment of all cast members and
                participants to work together as a team. Fourteen (14) days written notice is required to discontinue any class. A withdrawal form must be filled out by the parent and submitted to the front desk in person. No refund of prior tuition payments will be issued and any past due payment must be made at the time of official withdrawal. Showcase Cast students are subject to the withdrawal policy outlined in the Cast Agreement. Your account will remain active, until withdrawal procedures have been followed.
                </p>
                <h3>Attendance/Tardiness</h3>
                <p>▪ Consistent attendance is expected. In all our classes, the show rehearsals and educational elements are progressive, working off the previous week’s instruction.
                <br>▪ If you know your child will be absent for a class, please give the teacher at least 2 weeks notice if possible. Please call the studio anytime your child is ill or unable to attend class. This is important in planning for rehearsals each week.
                <br>▪ No tuition adjustments or credits are given for missed classes and no make-up classes will be offered.
                <br>▪ Habitual absenteeism may result in a student’s role in a show being re-assigned to another student.
                <br>▪ Classes will begin promptly at the scheduled time. Students are expected to be on time, in proper attire, and prepared for class. Students who are tardy miss important instruction and warm ups and disrupt the class.
                <br>▪ Students are expected to take responsibility for learning missed instruction, choreography, directions and blocking and for obtaining any missed information, handouts, etc. We make every effort to post all choreography on our communication app, SLACK. Teachers are always willing to help if asked and classmates can be a great resource as well. </p>
